> **Note:** This project is inspired in [GrumPHP](https://github.com./phpro/grumphp)!!!

Checker was developed for the purpose of configuring and executing your actions in git hooks,
besides being able to create and execute commands as you wish,
without counting the possibility of executing the same task with different configurations.
What makes it more powerful than GrumPHP!
