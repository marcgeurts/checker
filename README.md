> **Note:** This project is inspired in [GrumPHP](https://github.com./phpro/grumphp)!!!

I developed this project inspired in GrumPHP because I felt lack of power create and execute commands with their own tasks, not to mention that you can use the Checker and configure any git hoot, not just pre-commit and commit-msg.

Checker is more flexible and less dependent on other packages! Try now!

## Installation

Run the following command from you terminal:

```bash
composer require --dev cknow/checker:~1.0.0
```

or add this to ```require-dev``` section in your composer.json file:

```
"cknow/checker": "~1.0.0"
```

then run ```composer update```
