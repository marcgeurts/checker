> **Note:** This project is inspired in [GrumPHP](https://github.com./phpro/grumphp)!!!

I developed this project inspired in GrumPHP because I felt lack of power create and execute commands with their own tasks, not to mention that you can use the Checker and configure any git gain, not just pre-commit and commit-msg.

Checker is more flexible and less dependent on other packages so it does not come with any built-in task therefore you it is free to install only the desired tasks and run as you want!

One minute...
So I need develop all my tasks?
No, that would be insane! We have developed several tasks, simply set them and yes you are free to create your own.

_**Come on now install Checker. Do your best!**_

## Installation

Run the following command from you terminal:

```bash
composer require --dev cknow/checker:~0.1.0
```

or add this to ```require-dev``` section in your composer.json file:

```
"cknow/checker": "~0.1.0"
```

then run ```composer update```
